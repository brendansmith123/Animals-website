        Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae They are classified
        as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of
        bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of
        habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the
        Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America,
        South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears
        include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears,
        shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short
        tails.

        The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
        Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
        ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one
        species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
        researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due
        to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as
        morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are
        known from the fossil record.

        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to
        Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short,
        rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is
        sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
        prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A
        lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
        Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large
        ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some
        lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt
        humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

        Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder
        Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in
        the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes,
        thus monkeys (in that sense) constitute an incomplete paraphyletic
        grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes
        (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians
        synonyms in regard to their scope.

        An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the
        Crocodilia order in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae. The
        two extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and
        the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several extinct
        species of alligator are known from fossil remains. Alligators first
        appeared during the Oligocene epoch about 37 million years ago.[1]
